## üí™ Motivation

I didn't found any GUI application that allow me to manage my Wireguard VPN configuration. <br />
I wanted to make an application with nextauri since a while, so i took this opportunity to make it.

## Pre-requisites

In order to work properly, the application needs the following dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0-18 libicu70 libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37 wireguard resolvconf
```

## üì¶ Installation

Release are currently only available as a .deb package for Debian/Ubuntu.
It can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/leon3s/wireguard-gui/releases/latest)

## üöÄ Demo

A demo will be recorded soon.

## üé® Developing

Be sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed on your system

1.  See Tauri [prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/) to prepare your system to build `Tauri`

2.  Clone or fork this repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/leon3s/wireguard-gui
    cd wireguard-gui
    ```
3.  Install node dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

To get started you only need one command

```sh
npm run dev
```

## ‚ö°Production

To build in production you can do it in a single command.
This will build and export Next.js and build Tauri for your current environnement.

```sh
npm run tauri build
```
